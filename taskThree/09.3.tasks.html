        <a href="#">Billions of dollars</a> are spent at sporting events, on
        sports teams, on sports events, as well as on sports-related equipment
        and apparel. This guide is devoted to those sports that are the largest
        in terms of monies at the professional level, and as a result, not every
        sport is included. The primary focus is on the professional sports
        industry in the United States although there are a few instances in
        which the international aspects of the industry are mentioned. Because
        of the focus on professional sports, the Olympics and amateur events are
        not included.

      <p><strong>What is a healthy diet?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying
        unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love.
        Rather, its about feeling great, having more energy, improving your
        health, and boosting your mood.
      </p>

        While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of
        protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets
        to sustain a healthy body. You don't need to eliminate certain
        categories of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest
        options from each category.
