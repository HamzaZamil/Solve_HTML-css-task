    <p><em>4 out of 5 stars</em></p>

    <p>
      From director <strong>Vicki Fleming</strong> comes the heartwarming tale
      of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover (voiced by Brinson
      Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learning the true value of
      friendship sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover
      plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it.

    <p>This movie has everything you could ask for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basketball</li>
      <li>A dog</li>
      <li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's
      championship game in real time, Basketball Dog will keep your interest for
      the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, and the end will have any dog lover in
      tears. If you love basketball or sports pets, this is the movie for you.
